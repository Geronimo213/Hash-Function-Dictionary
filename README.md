# Hash-Function-Dictionary
Testing hash functions using Single Probing, Quad Probing, Seperate Chaining, and Double Hashing in order to implement a dictionary.

## Purpose
Test out multiple forms of handling collisions in hash functions. Supports:
- Single Probing
- Quad Probing
- Seperate Chaining
- Double Hashing

## Implementation
Implemented in Java. Seperate class files for each type of collision handling (so I could reuse any class should I wish in the future).

## Results
Well it works. Is it the best hashing function? Probably not, but you could google that if you want it. It's also not the most optimized program, but if you're running it on a pentium 4 or better, the time should be negligible.
